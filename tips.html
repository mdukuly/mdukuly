        <h3>"Fully Vacinated" <span>doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</span></h3>
        
        <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
            vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still
            “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 
            vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against 
            severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
            vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give 
            you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of 
            being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p>

        <h4>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to 
                others, including other vaccinated people?</h4>

        <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
            rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
            response to vaccines. </p>

         <p>“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
            disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. 
            We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these 
            vulnerable populations.”</p>
